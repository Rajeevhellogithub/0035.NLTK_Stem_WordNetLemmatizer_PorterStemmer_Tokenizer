      "I    have    three    visions    for    India    .    In    3000    years    of    our    history    ,    people    from    all    over    the    world    have    come    and    invaded    us    ,    captured    our    lands    ,    conquered    our    minds    .    From    Alexander    onwards    ,    the    Greeks    ,    the    Turks    ,    the    Moguls    ,    the    Portuguese    ,    the    British    ,    the    French    ,    the    Dutch    ,    all    of    them    came    and    looted    us    ,    took    over    what    was    ours    .    Yet    we    have    not    done    this    to    any    other    nation    .    We    have    not    conquered    anyone    .    We    have    not    grabbed    their    land    ,    their    culture    ,    their    history    and    tried    to    enforce    our    way    of    life    on    them    .    Why    ?    Because    we    respect    the    freedom    of    others.That    is    why    my    first    vision    is    that    of    freedom    .    I    believe    that    India    got    its    first    vision    of    this    in    1857    ,    when    we    started    the    War    of    Independence    .    It    is    this    freedom    that    we    must    protect    and    nurture    and    build    on    .    If    we    are    not    free    ,    no    one    will    respect    us    .    My    second    vision    for    India    ’    s    development    .    For    fifty    years    we    have    been    a    developing    nation    .    It    is    time    we    see    ourselves    as    a    developed    nation    .    We    are    among    the    top    5    nations    of    the    world    in    terms    of    GDP    .    We    have    a    10    percent    growth    rate    in    most    areas    .    Our    poverty    levels    are    falling    .    Our    achievements    are    being    globally    recognised    today    .    Yet    we    lack    the    self-confidence    to    see    ourselves    as    a    developed    nation    ,    self-reliant    and    self-assured    .    Isn    ’    t    this    incorrect    ?    I    have    a    third    vision    .    India    must    stand    up    to    the    world    .    Because    I    believe    that    unless    India    stands    up    to    the    world    ,    no    one    will    respect    us    .    Only    strength    respects    strength    .    We    must    be    strong    not    only    as    a    military    power    but    also    as    an    economic    power    .    Both    must    go    hand-in-hand    .    My    good    fortune    was    to    have    worked    with    three    great    minds    .    Dr.    Vikram    Sarabhai    of    the    Dept    .    of    space    ,    Professor    Satish    Dhawan    ,    who    succeeded    him    and    Dr.    Brahm    Prakash    ,    father    of    nuclear    material    .    I    was    lucky    to    have    worked    with    all    three    of    them    closely    and    consider    this    the    great    opportunity    of    my    life    .    I    see    four    milestones    in    my    career    .    india    is    great    compare    to    other    country    "
